    "    1. How many of the survived were male, female? Within this, how many were children in each gender category?\n",
    "    2. What does the SibSp, Parch, Cabin, Embark column signify? Can we attach external datasets to enrich the information?\n",
    "    3. Is Fare just a number or is correlated with other columns? If yes, which ones?\n",
    "    4. Students can add more such questions.\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. Advanced (assignment 2): Fit a model like LogisticRegression and RandomForestRegressor using sklearn.\n",
